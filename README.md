# Midterm Project by Hayden Burnell

## Description

### A 5-page website consiting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The Home Page consists of a CSS3 Animation on the title of my beer brand, a description of the taste, style, and what to serve it with!

The About Page explains when the company was started, how it started, and the company slogan..."Normal is Weird".

The Products Page talks about the main beer brand, and other products by the company. This is the page where I implemented the JavaScript. When you hover over the labels of the beer flavours, you can see the description of the taste!

The Advertisements Page is currently a placeholder for designs later on. I have temporarily implemented a CSS3 animation of the Normal is Weird slogan.

The Contact Us page has text boxes to enter your name, email, phone, and comments/questions as well as a skill testing question to weed out spam.

Thanks for checking out my website!
